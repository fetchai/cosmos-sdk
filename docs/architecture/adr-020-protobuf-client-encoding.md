# ADR 020: Protocol Buffer Client Encoding

## Changelog

- 2020 March 06: Initial Draft

## Status

Proposed

## Context

This ADR is a continuation of the motivation, design, and context established in
[ADR 019](./adr-019-protobuf-state-encoding.md), namely, we aim to design the
Protocol Buffer migration path for the client-side of the Cosmos SDK.

Specifically, the client-side migration path primarily includes tx generation and
signing, message construction and routing, in addition to CLI & REST handlers and
business logic (i.e. queriers).

With this in mind, we will tackle the migration path via two main areas, txs and
querying.
